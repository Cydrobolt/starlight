Hello there,

We are Samuel Damashek, chaoyi Zha, Fox Wilson, and Srijay Kasturi. We are high school students living on the 
eastern coast of the U.S. We decided to build StarLight, an app that sheds light onto the COSMIC hospital patients.
To solve this problem, we used JavaScript, BootStrap, and HTML on the front end, and Python with Flask on the backend.
We decided to use an user-friendly and easy-to-use approach, because many of the patients are ill and do not have time to fill in long rows of radio buttons.
Additionally, we kept the questions short, due to the decrease in responses that accompany long surveys. 

We hope you like our app, and thank you for taking the time to consider our submission.

Regards,

Chaoyi Zha, Fox Wilson, Samuel Damashek, and Srijay Kasturi
